        "description": "Hierarchical 3DGS is a dataset released with H3DGS paper. We implement the two public single-chunks scenes (SmallCity, Campus) used for evaluation. To collect the dataset, authors used a bicycle helmet on which they mounted 6 GoPro HERO6 Black cameras (5 for the Campus scene). They collected SmallCity and BigCity captures on a bicycle, riding at around 6â€“7km/h, while Campus was captured on foot wearing the helmet. Poses were estimated using COLMAP with custom parameters and hierarchical mapper. Additinal per-chunk bundle adjustment was performed. It is recommended to use exposure modeling with this dataset",
